## 💡 Production Tips for the USER

> [!TIP]
> **Visual Style**: Use a high-contrast dark mode aesthetic (Background: `#0b0e14`) with vibrant blue and green accents to match the platform's UI.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Screen Recordings**: When recording the demo segments, ensure you use a "clean" browser profile with no bookmarks or extensions visible. Use a cursor-highlighter to guide the viewer's eye.

> [!NOTE]
> **Background Music**: Start with a low-tension, slightly mysterious synth pad. Transitions to an upbeat, driving "tech-corporate" track during the reveal (0:25) to build momentum.
